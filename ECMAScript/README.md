# Synopsis

**ECMAScript** (or **ES**) is a ***trademarked scripting-language specification*** standardized by ***Ecma International*** in **ECMA-262** and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including ***JScript*** and ***ActionScript***. ECMAScript is commonly used for ***client-side scripting*** on the ***World Wide Web***, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using ***Node.js***.
